GuessingGame
============
This is a guessing game program in which a function my_random_num() generates a random whole number between 1 and 100 and the main() function allows the player to guess that number. A set_rand_seed() function is used to reset the seed of random number generator every time you run the program. The program should allow only five guesses, and it will tell the player whether the guess is too low, too high, or right. For instance, the following are two possible outputs. Note, your test runs need to capture one outcome as guessed right, one outcome as guessed wrong, and another one of your choice.

Sample input/output test runs (2 test runs)

The secret number is between 1 and 100.  
What is your guess? 5
Too low, guess again? 45 
Too low, guess again? 92
Too high, guess again? 46   
Right! It took you 4 tries.  

The secret number is between 1 and 100.  
What is your guess? 7
Too low, guess again? 25 
Too low, guess again? 92
